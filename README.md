# 🛍️ Diwali-Sales-EDA

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data. The aim is to analyze customer purchasing behavior and patterns during the Diwali festival season to uncover insights useful for marketing, sales strategy, and customer segmentation.

## Project Structure

* Diwali Sales Data.csv: The dataset contains customer demographic details, product categories, order counts, and purchase amounts.
* Diwali Sales EDA.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook performs data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw sales data.
* Analyze customer demographics (age, gender, marital status).
* Explore purchasing patterns across different regions, states, and product categories.
* Visualize insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
📊 Key Steps in the Notebook
Imported necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
Loaded and cleaned the dataset (e.g., removed null values and unnecessary columns).
Conducted EDA on:
Gender-based and age-group-based spending.
Geographic distribution of orders and revenue.
Occupation-wise purchasing patterns.
Popular product categories during the Diwali season.
Created visualizations (bar plots, count plots, etc.) to support findings.
🔧 Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
📈 Sample Insights
Married women aged 26–35 were among the top spenders.
Western and Southern zones showed the highest sales volumes.
Certain occupations (like IT and healthcare) showed distinct buying behavior.
A few product categories consistently drove higher revenues.
